# Welcome to my data analyst portfolio!

A little bit about myself: 
- UofT graduate with an honors degree in Management & IT with a passion for data analytics & project management
- Extensive leadership experience with a strong academic foundation & a drive to apply analytical skills to real-world problems
- Excellent problem-solving & analytical skills with a proven ability to work both independently & as a team member
- Eager to contribute expertise in data-driven decision making & project management to drive business success

My coursework included a range of subjects, from business data analytics to management skills, which provided me with a solid foundation for tackling complex problems and driving data-driven decisions.  
  
I believe that in today's dynamic business landscape, the ability to extract actionable insights from data is a superpower. I've honed my skills in data analysis, utilizing tools like SQL, Python, Excel VBA and PowerBI to process, merge, clean, analyze, and visualize diverse data sources. I am passionate about data analysis, data visualization, data reporting, data management, business analysis, and business intelligence insights.  
  
Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I firmly believe that life is about creating oneself. This philosophy has driven me to explore various interests and continually seek personal growth.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWS
Below is a description and brief overview for each project!

[1. Data Correlations and linear Regression (Python)](https://arai-mn.github.io/DataCorrelations-LinearRegression/)<br />
This project explores the sale prices of different homes in a small town in Iowa, USA. The project's objective is to use linear regression to predict the house prices as accurately as possible, understanding what drives housing prices and how potential home owners value different features of a house. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Linear regression <br />
<br />
<br />
[2. Data analysis, Outliers/Categorical Imputation ](https://arai-mn.github.io/AirBnB-dataAnalysis/)<br />
This project investigates the main factors that motivate people to book AirBnB accommodations. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Data Cleaning, Field inconsistencies, Modifying Dataframes, Categorical Imputation, Outliers <br />
<br />
<br />
[3. Android venue booking app](https://arai-mn.github.io/CSCB07_venuebookingapp_Android/)<br />
This Android application serves as a versatile tool for managing venues and events through Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. It caters to both regular users and administrators, each having distinct permissions for creating, modifying, and deleting venues. The app was developed in Android Studio and integrated with the Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication APIs.<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Firebase, Android Studio, Java <br />
<br />
<br />
[4. Flask, SQLite website ](https://arai-mn.github.io/cscb20/)<br />
In collaboration with two team members, I developed and established a course website that incorporated a robust backend system for user registration and authentication, along with features for grading and providing feedback. This was achieved using Flask and SQLite as the backend technologies.<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Flask, SQLite, Python, BCrypt, HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br />
<br />
<br />
[5. MERN stack website, SCRUM methodology](https://arai-mn.github.io/cscb20/)<br />
