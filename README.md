# Arailym Mussilim
Welcome to my data analyst portfolio!

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with an honors degree in Management and IT.  

My coursework included a range of subjects, from business data analytics to management skills, which provided me with a solid foundation for tackling complex problems and driving data-driven decisions.  
  
I believe that in today's dynamic business landscape, the ability to extract actionable insights from data is a superpower. I've honed my skills in data analysis, utilizing tools like SQL, Python, Excel VBA and PowerBI to process, merge, clean, analyze, and visualize diverse data sources. I am passionate about data analysis, data visualization, data reporting, data management, business analysis, business intelligence insights.  
  
Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I firmly believe that life is about creating oneself. This philosophy has driven me to explore various interests and continually seek personal growth.  
  
I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals, learn from their experiences, and explore opportunities for collaboration. If you share my passion for data-driven decision-making and effective project management, let's connect!
